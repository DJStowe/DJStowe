# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello! I'm Devin (He/They)

I'm a computer engineer with a background in software validation, hardware design, and a habit of diving head first into technical projects. I'm also a passionate musician and producer, I love to combine my hobbies and make tools that make recording, mixing, and producing music easier.

Here's what I love:

- **Music Tech**: From MIDI interfaces to refurbishing instruments and building guitar pedals.
- **Procedural Generation**: Crafting complex, algorithm-driven environments.
- **RTOS**: Exploring the intricacies of real-time systems.

My languages of choice are C, C++, and Python. I started with C almost 10 years ago, then moved to C++ for its OOP capabilities. Eventually I embraced Python for its extensive libraries.

This is a fresh start on GitHub after a brief hiatus, ready to contribute to open-source once again. Dive into my projects to see where technology and creativity intersect.

Let's innovate together!
